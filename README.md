# week9_mapanimation

Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN- January 2022 from MIT.

Map animattion Excercise.

Coding with js and api from Mbti that can customize for but routes, bus stop, train, and etc.
What I wanted to custmzie was that there gonna be two buttons for bus routes and subway routes, and if I click rouet number of the list, all buses or train will show on the map as marker.

Still working on because I spent too much time to understanding how to filter out what I want from api data.
So far it only shows two but routes, 1 and 60 for the test. Will be updated with new buttons and more routes.


(html, css, js)
